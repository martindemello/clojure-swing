h1. Webby S5 Generator

Clever introductory text that will grab the audience's attention.


h1. Title of the First Slide

A little more build up before really getting into the meat of it.


h1. Title of the Second Slide

Finally, some code!

<% uv :lang => "ragel", :theme => 'twilight' do -%>
action dgt      { printf("DGT: %c\n", fc); }
action dec      { printf("DEC: .\n"); }
action exp      { printf("EXP: %c\n", fc); }
action exp_sign { printf("SGN: %c\n", fc); }
action number   { /*NUMBER*/ }

number = (
    [0-9]+ $dgt ( '.' @dec [0-9]+ $dgt )?
    ( [eE] ( [+\-] $exp_sign )? [0-9]+ $exp )?
) %number;

main := ( number '\n' )*;
<% end -%>


h1. Title of the Third Slide

This code comes from a partial

<%= render :partial => 'sample_code', :guard => true %>


h1. Title of the Fourth Slide

A quadratic equation with real or complex coefficients has two (not necessarily distinct) solutions, called roots, which may or may not be real, given by the quadratic formula:

<% tex2img 'quadratic', :path => 'images', :alt => 'quadratic', :resolution => '300x300' do -%>
x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt[]{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
<% end -%>


h1. The Final Slide

And that about sums it up!
