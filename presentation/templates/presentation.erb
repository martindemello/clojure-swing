h1. Presentation Title

Clever introductory text that will grab the audience's attention.


h1. Title of the First Slide

A little more build up before really getting into the meat of it.


h1. Title of the Second Slide

Finally, some code!

<%% uv :lang => 'ruby', :line_numbers => false do -%>
class EnglishMajor
  def supercilious
    'behaving or looking as though one thinks one is superior to others'
  end
end
<%% end -%>


h1. The Final Slide

And that about sums it up!
